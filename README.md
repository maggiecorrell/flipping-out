Flipping Out

Objectives
- understand basic statistics
- understand the use of different plot types
- be able to use Jupyter Notebooks
- be able to use the statistics module

Normal Mode
- create a function that flips a coin, n, number of times.  The default should be 2**16
- record the intervals of heads and tail at different intervals, starting at 2**0 the progressing exponentially (2**1, 2**2, 2**3,... 2**n)
- make a line plot of the difference between heads and tails and then a line plot with the ratio between heads and tails
- then recreate the same as scatter plots with a logarithmic scale for the x-axis
- run 20 trials of 2**16 and record the mean and standard deviation
- create scatter plots with logarithmic scales for both the mean and standard deviation
- run 100,000 trials of 100 coin flips; then 100,000 for 1,000 coin flips
      - create a histogram of the ratio of heads to tails for each trials
      - create a box and whiskers graph for both trails
